# A-Phone-Directory
This is a Phone directory coded in C. This project includes combination of merge sort and randomized quick sort algorithm to sort the directory based on the names of contacts and phone number respectively. I have also made use of binary search algorithm to quickly search the existing contact.  The program is also capable of parsing a CSV or a txt file to pull the data which includes Index, Name and, phone number and store it respectively.  I have implemented all CRUD operations required for a phone directory with efficiency.
